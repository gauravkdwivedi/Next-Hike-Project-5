## Overview

The Mobile Telecom Analytics project aims to analyze user engagement and experience data in a mobile telecommunications network. The project includes data cleaning, user engagement metrics calculation, clustering analysis, and the development of a satisfaction score model.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks used for data analysis and modeling. (optional)
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `results/`: Stores the output files generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2. pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To leverage the Mobile Telecom Analytics project for analyzing user engagement and experience in a mobile telecommunications network.

## Project Objectives

1. **User Engagement Analysis:**
   - Calculate key engagement metrics, including session frequency, session duration, and total traffic.
   - Explore patterns in user behavior to understand how customers interact with the mobile network.

2. **User Experience Analysis:**
   - Assess user experience metrics, such as average TCP retransmission, round-trip time (RTT), and throughput.
   - Identify factors that contribute to a positive or negative user experience.

3. **Satisfaction Score:**
   - Develop a satisfaction score that combines both user engagement and experience metrics.
   - Classify users into satisfaction clusters to better understand and address different user segments.

4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Utilize machine learning models, including clustering algorithms and regression models, to uncover hidden patterns in the data.
   - Predict user satisfaction scores based on engagement and experience features.

5. **Results and Insights:**
   - Provide actionable insights and recommendations for telecom providers to enhance their services.
   - Deliver visualizations and reports that facilitate decision-making processes.
